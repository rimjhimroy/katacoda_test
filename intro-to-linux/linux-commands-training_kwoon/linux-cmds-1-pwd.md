`pwd` stands for Print Working Directory.  

Some examples of directories in the Linux OS are `/root, /boot, /bin, /opt, /run, /usr` and `/home`.

The `pwd` command tells you the current folder where you are.  
The default directory that you start out with is the home directory of the user who is logged in.  
If you are the root user, your first directory would be `/`.  
If you are a user named `duke`, then your home directory would be `/home/duke`  

Type `pwd`{{execute}} and press enter.  

You will find that you are in the `/` directory as shown below.
Note:The hostname (The value after the word `root@` may be different than what is shown below.)
`root@1d57118366ce:/# pwd
/`
