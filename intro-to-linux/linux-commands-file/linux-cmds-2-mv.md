`mv` stands for Move.  
It can be used to move or rename files.

If there is a file that you need to move into another directory you can use the `mv` command to do so. Let us organize the `famous_scientists.txt` into the `scientists` folder.  

Type `mv famous_scientists scientists/`{{execute}} and press enter.  

Type `ls`{{execute}} and see if the `famous_scientists.txt` is there. It has been moved to the `scientists` folder.  

Type in `cd scientists/`{{execute}}  

Now see if the `famous_scientists.txt` is there. `ls`{{execute}}
