Bioinformatics depends heavily on Linux-based computers and software. A lot of good scientific software is written specifically for Linux/Unix. Additionally, Linux has most popular programming languages (e.g.Python, Perl, C) already installed and ready to use! Data management happens swiftly with the dedicated text manipulation tools and file system properties. This training will teach you all you need to know to swiftly start using Linux, be it on the server of your department, or on your own computer (even if you're already running Windows or Mac OS).  

Most of the tools are command line driven and if you want to Bioinformatics, it is very important that you become very familiar with how to use the linux command line and the basic and advance Linux commands.  
The more you practice these commands, the more you will remember them.  

Remember, a Computational biologist always practices, practices and practices to become perfect.
