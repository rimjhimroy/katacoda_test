Most movies or TV shows that show someone hacking, usually show you a screen (aka Terminal) with green font with the hacker actor, typing in commands into the terminal. This is the Linux Command line. The Linux command line or Shell is an OS process that allows you to control the computer by using commands that you type in as text interface. With modern Desktop Environments, the need for using the Shell is not as needed.   

However most hacking tools are command line driven and if you want to learn hacking, it is very important that you become very familiar with how to use the linux command line and the basic and advance Linux commands.  

The more you practice these commands, the more you will remember them.  

Remember, a Cyber Ninja always practices, practices and practices to become perfect.
