`cat` stands for Concatenate

It is the command that is used to concatenate (read and adds) and print the contents of a file.

The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output (terminal).

To read what the `README.txt` contents in the villains directory, you can first navigate into the `villains` directory using the `cd` command and then use the `cat` command to read the contents of the `README.txt` file.

Type `cd villains`{{execute}} and press enter.  

Then Type `cat README.txt`{{execute}} and press enter.     
You will see the following text print on the screen.  
`The villians list that you are looking for is not here.
It must be hiding somewhere.
Pay careful attention as you search... for even a dot can mean a lot.
Can you try to 'locate' the villains file?`

Note: The `cat` command is used extensively in managing files in Linux.
