We are in a virtual UNIX environment and an **an rstudio-server is being prepared for you**.  
Click the [Dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8787-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/) tab on the right to see the interface when it is ready. But before that, let's explore where we are.

Open a new terminal using the "+" on the right.
Type in `pwd`{{execute}}; `lsb_release -a`{{execute}}

Some plastid files were copied to your environment, let's see what those files are:
Now type in `ls`{{execute}}

Enter the folder plastid_sequence_analysis: `cd plastid_sequence_analysis`{{execute}}, and explore `ls`{{execute}}

As you see, I have copied the plastid fasta sequences along with annotation tables (gff files) for the eight species. Also you have the output GeSeq codon based alignments in the folder.  

Now let's go the Rstudio waiting for you in the Dashboard tab on the right.
