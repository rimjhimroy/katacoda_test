__Linux Commands are CaSe SeNsItIvE__  
The first thing to know is that Linux commands are CaSe SeNsItIvE - meaning that if you type the commands in the wrong case (uppercase or lowercase or mixed-case), the command will not work and you will most likely get a “command not found” message on the terminal.  

Type in `date`{{execute}} and press enter.    
You should see the date and timestamp displayed on your terminal screen.  

Now type in `Date`{{execute}} (with an uppercase Date) and press enter.  
You will be notified that there is no command called `Date` and that the `Date` command is not found.  
You may also be suggested other commands that Linux would recognize as shown below.   
`No command 'Date' found, did you mean:
 Command 'date' from package 'coreutils' (main)
 Command 'yate' from package 'yate' (universe)
 Command 'late' from package 'late' (universe)
 Command 'kate' from package 'kate' (universe)
Date: command not found`

This proves that Linux is CaSe SeNsItIvE!
