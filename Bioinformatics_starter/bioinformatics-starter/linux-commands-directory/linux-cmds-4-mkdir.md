`mkdir` stands for Make Directory.  
It is used to create a folder or directory so that you can be organized.  

You can think of directories like a bookshelf. In the top shelf you may have your school books, the middle shelf may have some fiction books and the bottom shelf may contain some activity books. So also in a computer system, you can organize your files in directories.   

Let us first create your directory. This directory will store your favorite game files in it.  

Type `mkdir myGames`{{execute}} and press enter.  

What happened? It may seem like nothing happened if your command ran successfully.  

To see if your directory was created successfully, you can use the `ls` command which will list all the contents of the current directory where you are.

Type `ls`{{execute}} and press enter.

You should see aa directory/folder called `myGames`
