`grep` stands for Global Regular Expression Print  

We can use the `grep` command to search specifically for a word or phrase in a text file. If you want to search for one word in a extremely huge document you can use the `grep` command.  

Since we know that this list contains villain names we can search for a villain using the `grep` command.
