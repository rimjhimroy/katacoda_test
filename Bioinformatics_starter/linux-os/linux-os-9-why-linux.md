## Why linux
Many Linux distros already have the necessary data processing tools readily available to use in them. If a bioinformatics application does not exist, then it can be easily installed on the Linux OS and distributed.

1. Unix texttools and vim, emacs etc... one often works with text files and always has to peek a little bit (head, tail), mangle them (sort, cut, paste) etc...
2. Easy to build simple pipelines (awk, bash, piping, bash redirection, texttools)
3. Simple to install and use software development tools (gcc, g++, python, perl) On linux they are all installed and configured with one click.
4. Multiple versions of a program can be installed by the user himself and switched on/off with sourcing some scripts without being administrator. On windows I always had to change the path in a very, very small textfield to which I had to click about 4 times.
5. A lot of good scientific software is written in a non portable way for linux/unix (almost all short read aligners, samtools). This makes it necessary to use Unix for genomics.
6. X windows: work on a powerful server and have the GUI on your thin client

So if you want to learn bioinformatics as a hobbyist, or for professional purposes, it is important that you learn and master Linux.
