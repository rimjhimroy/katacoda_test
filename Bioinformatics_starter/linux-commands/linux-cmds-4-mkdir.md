`mkdir` stands for Make Directory.  
It is used to create a folder or directory so that you can be organized.  

You can think of directories like a bookshelf. In the top shelf you may have your school books, the middle shelf may have some fiction books and the bottom shelf may contain some activity books. So also in a computer system, you can organize your files in directories.  

You notice that there are some files in there, but no folders (or directories) to organize them. So let us create two directories to organize these files.
The two directories you are going to create are a directory called `dc` and another one called `marvel`.  

Type `mkdir dc`{{execute}} and press enter.  
What happened? It may seem like nothing happened if your command ran successfully.  

To see if your directory was created successfully, you can use the `ls` command which will list all the contents of the current directory where you are.  

Type `ls`{{execute}} and press enter.  

You should see aa directory/folder called `dc`.  

Now type `mkdir marvel`{{execute}} and press enter.  

__And is &&__  
NOTE: You could have also created both the directories in a single command using the `&&` operand. The command in that case would have been `mkdir dc && mkdir marvel`.
