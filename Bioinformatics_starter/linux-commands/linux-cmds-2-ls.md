`ls` stands for list directory contents.  

The `ls` command displays the names of files contained within a directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

Type `ls`{{execute}} and hit enter.

You should see several directories. One directory that is of interest that we will use for our learning is the `cybershaolin` directory.

`root@2c76ac044cd9:/# ls
bin   cybershaolin  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  dev           home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var`
